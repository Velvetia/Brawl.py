# Brawl.py

Brawlhalla API wrapper written in Python.

I'm trying to aim for this to be simple to understand and to use.

# Installation

If you really want to try it out, download the zip, and extract it into your site-programs Python folder. It should usually be found in your Python install directory.

# Progress

Current Progress: ~35%

Current Objectives:

- Create classes for most of the response options, so they can be more easily accessed.

- Put the errors.py to good use.

- Make the information in the response JSON more easily accessible. (You currently have to do convoluted stuff like "print(resp["error"]["code"])" in order to get specific items.)
