# Brawlthon

Brawlhalla API wrapper written in Python.

Don't count on this to reasonably get finished. This maybe be a project for me, but I am no Python user.

Also, DEFINITELY do not expect this to be good code. There will likely be multiple hashed together workarounds in this. Fair warning.

# Installation

You can't yet.

Current Progress: 30%

Current Objectives:

- Create classes for most of the response options, so they can be more easily accessed.

- Put the errors.py to good use.
